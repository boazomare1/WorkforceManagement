## 🎯 **Why Restaurants Choose Us Over Competitors**

### **💬 "We tried Toast first..."**

**— Restaurant Owner, Chicago**

### **💬 "Square couldn't handle our volume..."**

### **💬 "Lightspeed required an IT team..."**
*"Lightspeed is powerful but impossibly complex. We spent $5,000 on consultants just to set it up. [Your Company] works perfectly out of the box - my teenage staff figured it out in minutes."*
